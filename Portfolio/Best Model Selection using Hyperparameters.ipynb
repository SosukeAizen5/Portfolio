    "Looking at the exercises holistically, I was interested to see that with the inclusion of more classifiers with their corresponding parameters, the accuracy of the best model decreased. Also, the model changed from being a KNN classifier to a logistic regression classifier. In addition, the best parameter changed from n_neighbors to classifier__C. The search space initially helped to increase the KNN classifier's accuracy, yet after the introduction of the new classifiers, the search space was too large to optimize the hyperparameters that needed to be selected to benefit model accuracy. The default KNN started at 61% accuracy, then jumped to 67% accuracy with the inclusion of the search space for the KNN values, then fell to 65% with the addition of the two other classifiers with their own parameters. Granted, the whole basis of these models was a dataset that looked at the ability of loan candidates to be classified as being accepted or rejected. With the highest model accuracy being right only two-thirds of the time is rather low for a large financial investment. In my opinion, I think another model strategy would be a better option to improve accuracy so banks and customers alike can be certain that the income they have is sufficient for the loan not to default.
